## **About myself:**

I am striving to acquire a new specialty and get a position as a _'frontend developer'_ at this stage. In the future, I plan to acquire and improve skills in the field of web development. I try to approach the solution of problems objectively and multilaterally. I do not stop thinking about solving the problem, until it is completely completed. 

I was developing a site in a company from my city (layout is on [github](https://maks-1987.github.io/kontinentserv/) ). In the course of work, I got acquainted with the jQuery library, the BEM methodology and _SlickSlider_. I have no commercial (combat) experience in web development, but I really want to develop and learn in this direction.

**Аcquired skills:**

> HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS), JS(ES6), Git, WebPack 5. Favorite code editor - VScode.

## **Sample code:**
